*“The only people for me are the mad ones, the ones who are mad to live, mad to talk, mad to be saved, desirous of everything at the same time, the ones who never yawn or say some commonplace thing, but burn, burn, burn, like fabulous yellow roman candles exploding like spiders across the stars and in the middle you see the blue centerlight pop and everybody goes ‘Awww\!’”* 

-“On the Road,” Jack Kerouac

I want to tell the story of the most important man in human history. Not Prometheus, discoverer of fire. Not Leonardo da Vinci, although the Mona Lisa is pretty cool. Not even Vasily Aleksandrovich Arkhipov, who prevented human extinction during the Cuban Missile Crisis by refusing to launch nuclear torpedoes off of a false alarm.  

In fact, you probably don’t know this man’s name, although he is pretty much the only reason I had a chance—ever—to be born.  

The hero of my story is Norman Ernest Borlaug.

Norman was not born to save the world. From a small farm in Iowa, he spent his days toiling under the hot summer sun. Acres of corn, oats, and timothy-grass surrounded him; his day to day was spent tending to his family's crop. This unremarkable existence was punctuated with days of school, at the one-teacher, one-room New Oregon \#8 rural school in Howard County. Did that one teacher recognize Norman as the man he would become?  

In 1935, he became a leader in the Civilian Conservation Corps. He watched hundreds starve without food. He did not see this as a social problem: instead of economics, he turned to

biology. 7 years later, with a Ph.D. in plant pathology of all things, he set out to solve world hunger (at least temporarily).  

He succeeded. His strains of wheat gave life to billions. His dissenters told him, "I have yet to meet anyone familiar with the situation who thinks India will be self-sufficient in food by 1971." Those dissenters weren’t even a little right. 5 years later, my mother was born, with hunger pushing her to the edge of death even with his “Green Revolution.” She would simply not have survived infancy without it. This ordinary man from a tiny farm in Iowa saved my mothers life.  

According to everyone I know, I am absolutely nothing like Norman Ernest Borlaug.

Instead of New Oregon \#8 rural school in Howard County, I go to Phillips Exeter Academy, with

1.8 billion dollars of endowment spent on, well, putting me and 1200 other students through high school. He spent every day tending to his crop, hard, physical labor molding his mind and body. I can count the number of times I’ve been to the gym since prep year on one hand. I wonder if he was jacked. But despite our differences, we have one thing in common, or at least we will in 25 years give or take. If all goes right, I will have saved the world by then, just like he did.

Before I monologue about my plans, we have a detour.

For better or for worse, I don’t remember a lot of my childhood. It's a chest I refuse to open, a pandora's jar that I worry all of my troubles would flow from.  

However, I do remember stinging words with every lost chess tournament, every bad grade on a math test, every time I found myself too picky to eat dinner, every failure every time I got too rash and emotional and didn't try my best. My mother would say:

“I go back to India and adopt 100 kids with my salary. They would be so grateful for having books. Tell me why you are worth it.”  

I don’t think any seven year olds have a good answer to that question. I sure as hell didn’t. I would stand and cry and promise to do better, and she would tell me that “people who cry should never be trusted.” I guess I couldn’t win that argument, but what I could do is make a habit of winning my chess games and doing well on my math tests. If I never messed up, I would never have to confront my reality. 

It would be enough. I would be enough.

Five years later, I was a 7th grader. I had since found comfort within computers, well, within software engineering. I finally saw a clear purpose. Just go to high school, go to college, jump through a couple more hoops and I would get a nice, well-paying job at googleflixazon. I would watch countless videos about the campuses of Big Tech companies, with their cafeterias filled with more sorts of free food than I could imagine. I felt like Batman: by day I would attend classes just like my peers, by night I would tinker with robots to add to my resume, brush up on the latest Leetcode problems, practice fermi estimation so I could reliably calculate the number of pennies that could fill any room just in case my future interviewer would ask me to. I wished for nothing more than to fly out to Santa Clara California, land of good weather and vested stock options.  

When I applied for scholarships to go to a fancy private high school, I knew I had to go to Exeter, because duh, Zuckerberg went there. On my applications, I credited my parents for “preparing me well for the job market.” Not for raising me, feeding me, taking care of me all these years, but for making me one extremely employable 7th grader. They would sometimes complain about how I was becoming a “worker ant” like they were, that I would live out the rest

of my life in misery under the thumb of a boss I hated. They would stop complaining when I showed them L6 software engineer salaries on levels.fyi. Even they had to finally acknowledge that I had a future ahead of me. And for the first time, I felt like I did. I was in control of my destiny. It would be enough. I would be enough.

Three years later, I was a lower at Phillips Exeter Academy, alma mater of Facebook, or something. I was talking about my long-term goals in life to Neil, a close friend in his senior year. As we walked through the cold January snow, I told him all about my life plans, how I wanted to become somewhat rich, get 2 cats―the first one obviously needs a friend―and live out my life in peace and contentment. I expected approval, him to nod along, talk about what he was doing to reach the same goal, sigh and say “wouldn’t that be nice”. What other reason could he possibly have for majoring in computer science?  
Neil did none of the things I had imagined. He didn’t relate to, approve, or even respect what I wanted to do. Instead, he shook his head, staring at his black Nike sneakers as if I had let him down.  
“Achyuta you’re too good for that.”

I suppressed every urge in my body to punch him. I wished him a good night and walked back to Soule alone on the verge of tears. I felt less than worthless; I felt like the world I had built for myself so far had all been for naught. I was nothing more than the 7 year old standing in front of my parents, their words tearing like whips with every blow. That weak, useless 7 year old who couldn’t ace his math tests and convert winning chess positions. It certainly wasn’t enough. I certainly was not enough.

In the coming years, I grew obsessed: with making my life “worth it,” with doing something that I wasn’t “too good for.” If only I could do what Borlaug did. If only I could save the world. Maybe, just maybe then my sins would be absolved in my autobiography, played in IMAX cinemas alongside the 27th Mission Impossible Sequel (Tom Cruise is truly immortal). I need to become “somebody.” Screw finding fulfillment and happiness and two cats, I need my actions to play out on a civilizational scale. There’s nothing else remaining in my mind, I’m consumed by a desire for *more*. I want to fucking matter, not just to the people who know me. I want to matter to literally everyone. Maybe then, and only then, will I ever be enough.

I guess I have a job to do. Let’s see what the experts are up to, and by experts, I mean rich white men in Silicon Valley. I promise this is the last time they come up in this story.  

Over the last ten years, they got together over games of pickleball, craft beers, and rock climbing sessions, and decided to “do good better.” Effective Altruism was born. They call themselves as “a research field and practical community that aims to find the best ways to help others, and put them into practice.” Famous alumni include Sam Bankman-Fried, founder and CEO of FTX. We will all obviously remember that he represented a mission to “do good better,” while committing gross financial fraud, robbing hundreds of thousands of ordinary people of 8.7 billion dollars of their hard-earned ethereum.  
We live in a world where the “altruists” are serving ten years in prison for stealing people’s life savings. I can probably do better than that, right? So come with me as I figure out how exactly to save the world. Let’s go make mama proud.

We begin with shrimp. Yes, you heard me right. Shrimp.

Even the staunchest carnivores among us care about the well being of animals.

Compassion and love for other creatures is the most clear-cut mark of humanity; every serial killer started out by tormenting someone’s pet.  
So you obviously want to reduce animal suffering, how should you go about it? The boring answer is go vegan. We kill a lot of animals for food; your individual dietary choices are cool, but not the right scale for my purposes. We want to improve the welfare of livestock across the globe while still not biting off more than 1 person can chew (pun absolutely intended).  
Hence, our humble crustacean enters stage left.

The capacity for pain doesn’t really scale with size. Although it takes 40,000 shrimp to weigh as much as a cow, 40,000 shrimp are capable of experiencing much more pain than any cow ever could. While we farm 440 billion shrimp each year, more than 5x the total number of all farmed land animals put together, each one of those shrimp is surprisingly “smart.” In fact, shrimp are so smart that the government of the UK recognizes them as sentient creatures as of the 2022 Animal Welfare Act.  

Anything you can do to help the shrimp, from improving their water quality to stopping people from “ablating their eyestalks”(gross) directly translates into improvements for overall animal welfare. There are no diminishing returns. For every percent you reduce shrimp suffering, you reduce ALL livestock suffering by 0.85%. It's just a numbers game.  

You would do more than PETA ever could in its 53 years and billions of funding dollars.

I think that's sufficiently high shrimpact.

But I certainly can’t save the world by only helping animals. Humans suffer a lot, too.

Take obesity. I’m sure all of you know the general problem statement. Obesity directly and

indirectly causes all sorts of issues across the entire body, being correlated to cardiovascular disease, arthritis, and even cancer. My problem with obesity is a tad bit more specific.  

My mother has been clinically obese for as long as I can remember. She shows me old, dirty, yellowed film photographs from a time before me, a time where she was healthy and happy. I remember me and my sister working together to begrudgingly massage her legs, which were swollen from even walking around our apartment. I felt each rough callus and lesion against my soft childish hands. She rubbed her stomach as she asked me, over and over again as I grew into the person I am today, to invent a pill that could just magically “melt all her fat away.” I regret that I was never good enough at biology to give her any semblance of solace. I love my mom more than anyone: I feel powerless to help her.  

Maybe that’s ok, though. Maybe *I* don’t have to. Although I don’t understand de novo drug development, people do. Semaglutide seems to be a “wonder drug,” with a double blind clinical trial on thousands of patients yielding healthy weight loss from 10-30%. That’s comparable to the most extreme of surgical procedures, for just taking a drug once a week for a year. That’s the difference between the faded polaroids on my kitchen counter and my mother today.  

As far as we know, the drug works. However, a lifetime of effort is needed to turn this academic success into a true miracle, a miracle big enough to save the world from the ill effects of obesity, permanently. All that remains is just another logistical problem in the healthcare industry. The US is historically good at those, right?

If medicine isn’t your cup of tea—it isn’t mine—you can also try automating all of scientific discovery forever. I’m sure all of you love ChatGPT. What if I told you that at least in

contrived, toy circumstances, our friendly neighborhood chatbots can “do science.” Instead of humans working in lab coats, planning new experiments, new interventions to test, we can outsource thinking to machines.  

A few weeks back, it was published that GPT-4 can act “as a scientist by forming hypotheses, proposing experiments, and updating descriptions in light of new data.” I don’t know too many people who can consistently do that. It's obviously still in early stages, and will stay that way for a few decades. It’s certainly not the CEO of Anthropic, one of the world's leading 3 companies developing such technology, says that machines will match the intellect of a "generally well educated human," across any task in “2-3 years.” Oh wait. He said that 3 months ago. It’s certainly not like the Chair of the Federal Trade Commission called herself an “optimist” for assigning a 15% chance to the timeline where AI kills literally everyone. Oh wait. That was more like 3 days ago. Tick tock.  

Playing Russian Roulette (check the math) with all of civilization is not without its upsides. Along with the fears of skynet-style human extinction comes the promise of infinite power. Such an automatic scientist would be the last discovery we would ever need to make as a species. Whoever was smart (or dumb) enough to harness and control such a system would certainly get a Nobel. Or two. Or 1 every nanosecond for literally forever, as it reversed the heat death of the universe to get more time for inventions. Any sci-fi book you’ve read is simply not weird enough to imagine the world we would unlock. The other 5 chambers of our metaphorical loaded revolver contain a future among the stars, with no conceivable limit to human conquest of the entire observable universe. Galaxies would be our gas stations; a child’s allowance would be paid in nebulas, instead of nickels and dimes. Spinning the cylinder sounds like a pretty damn good deal now doesn’t it. What could be more worth the risk than everything?

While we’re talking about infinity, have you ever wanted to live forever? It probably sounded great at first, but as someone explained how you would watch everyone who has ever lived die one by one around you, watch all of the universe decay until there's nothing but quarks, gluons, and *you*, drifting endlessly without light or air or McDonald’s chicken nuggets.  
Immortality in this sense is pretty horrific, the ultimate sci-fi torture mechanism.

But to me, aging doesn’t sound great either.

The most painful piece of art I have ever consumed is a bandcamp album by the Caretaker.  
I remember listening to it all in one sitting, me in my room alone for a night.

It is a 6.5 hour long musical depiction of the progression of dementia. Through degrading loops of ballroom dance music, I felt what it means to lose the very fabric of reality.  
I remember listening to it all in one sitting, me in my room alone.

It is split into 6 acts, each representing more degradation, more corruption. I watched each detail become more and more indistinguishable from the rest.  
I remember listening to it all in one sitting.

Through each section, I found myself expending more and more energy to listen, trying to hold onto whatever’s left. I was fighting for air in a sea created by my mind.  
I remember listening to it all.

I didn’t sleep the rest of that night, or the night after. For 65 hours I stayed up haunted by memory.  
I remember listening.

Eventually I collapsed to sleep in an EPAC hallway, my body giving in.

I remember.

Every time I look in the mirror and count the increasing number of white hairs on my head, I grow increasingly terrified by my own mortality. The saying “all the money in the world can’t buy a second of time,” unsettles me. I want to choose when I die. I need time to be sure I’ve tied up all of the loose ends. I can’t have mother nature telling me when I’m done.  

Luckily, the infringement on our agency that is aging isn’t only painful, it's also optional—at least it could be. On the scale of cells, we can play with time; we can make them age faster, slower, or even backwards. There’s no physical laws remaining in our way; thermodynamics textbooks don’t comment on infinite life. All that’s left to do is for some brave souls on a crusade against death itself to do “just a little” scaling, from single cells to trillions. From there, the skies are the limit.

With that I conclude my whirlwind tour of possible high-impact lifetimes. Countless ideas didn’t make the cut, but I hope the ones that did were at the very least amusing.  

I’m not entirely sure why my ambitions grew to this scale. It was probably some unholy mixture of a fear of powerlessness, an egotistical notion that no goal is too lofty, and a few too many people who suddenly started to pretend to believe in me. Nonetheless, my dreams form the world’s best alarm clock; I would certainly prefer an infinite sleep if I didn’t know that I was destined to matter. It’s more than self-important to assume such grand, crushing responsibility; it’s irrational, delusional, and insane. How could I possibly expect this much from *my* life?  

Frankly, nothing less than the very top of the world even computes as a valid ending to my story. I finally have a satisfying answer to the question my mother would ask me a decade ago. *Why are you worth it achu?* Just wait, you’ll see.

I owe Norman Ernest Borlaug everything. I owe him that midnight spent belting indie rock alone on the rooftop of CERN’s main complex, only accessible through rickety ladders and one-way doors. I owe him that crumpled up suicide note I threw off the Golden Gate Bridge, my desperate effort to find meaning that dissolved into the frothy waves. I owe him the dozens of empty monster cans that covered my floor in prep year, a disgusting decoration displaying my degeneracy.  
I intend on paying my debt.
