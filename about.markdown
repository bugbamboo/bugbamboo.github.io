Hi, I'm Achyuta! I just wrapped up my first year studying physics at MIT. Currently, I'm doing a residency at OpenAI; I'm trying to build a science of model behavior based on scalable interpretability tooling. I've watched at least 20k hours of Youtube in my life; it's taught me how to design DGT chessboards, run experiments at CERN, and turn bananas into random numbers. Outside of work, I like solving puzzle hunts, playing chess, petting cats, and talking to Daniel Johnson.
