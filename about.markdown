I’m Achyuta Rajaram. I just wrapped up my first year studying physics at MIT. I’m excited about building scalable interpretability tools to better understand and control model behavior in real-world settings; I work on this at OpenAI under Dan Mossing. Outside of work, I like solving puzzle hunts, playing chess, petting cats, and talking to Daniel Johnson.
